Fatecasted will have beautiful packaging, which also serves a practical purpose. Dice are a huge part of the game, and players will need a way to roll their respective dice easily, quickly, and without mixing them up with another player's.

To accomplish this, Fatecasted starter bundles will include a container lined with a thin foam padding with suede upholstering. This container will be equal in width and length. Its height shall be less than the width or height, and will resemble a small but deep dish. The container will have a cover that is easily released, to make the viewing of the dice quick and accessible.

This container is meant to be used as a dice roller, where the player will simply place their dice into the container, seal it momentarily, shake it, set it back down, then view the results.

Alternatively, the container may be larger, meant to be used as a place to cast the dice. In this case, the container should have a compartment either on the bottom or as part of the lid where the player can safely store their card selection.

This will facilitate accessibility of playing the game, since it will remove the hassle that comes with needing to roll dice.

If the player does not want to roll physical dice, a [[Mobile Application]] should be available where they can roll using their smartphone or tablet.
