Before Fatecasted was a game, it was an idea; before *that* it was a feeling.

A feeling of frustration and yearning. I love competitive tabletop games set in imaginary worlds, with epic battles between fantasy creatures and characters.

As I write that out, I realize how much of a vanilla tabletop gamer you might think I am; and it's absolutely true. I really just love tabletop card games for the worlds and characters.

In all the time I had played strategic card games, some common themes started to emerge and, frankly, start to annoy me.

### Am I Even Here?
More and more it felt like wins and losses could come down to being a simple percentage and that odds could decide your fate more often than you yourself ever would. Sometimes, it felt like deckbuilding just boiled down to manipulating the odds. It didn't matter what kind of strategy you came up with, it really just comes down to how your draws play out in the end; with the only factors being how many risks your opponent takes or mistakes they make, as they are relying on their draws as much as you are on yours.

And really, that is what it actually does boil down to. What else are you doing when you're deciding to put 3 instead of 4 copies of a card in your MTG deck? You're really just messing with the odds. At that point, the shuffle can decide your fate, and it almost always feels like what kind of player you are had little to no bearing on that result when it happens.

### The Solution...
So I would get frustrated and burnt out on card games, always for the same reason. I would come back later, there would be some interesting new set of cards to check out with new mechanics... but then it would eventually get to same point as always. It just always felt like there was no escaping the odds.

So I thought, why don't I like that the odds are deciding a lot of things?
### It's kind of weird to dislike something that's a core part of the gameplay even before you start playing, right?
When I thought about it more and I realized when that happened and the past games where I've felt that -> It's because it feels like it was no one's fault. If you knew a game ended as a result of bad draws on either end, victories felt empty and losses were just flat-out discouraging. I could've been playing a great deck that I loved but get really bad draws, and the same went for my opponent. Or my opponent could be clearly playing something setup to counter the strategy I'm using, but get horrible draws and I win for no reason other than that their shuffle screwed them. 

And to be fair, despite this flaw it *does* work as a system. It works well enough to where gamers of all sorts are willing to interact with a system that has a certain amount of input randomness. Something like MTG has reached a point where the set of cards available or the strategies that can be used are so stable that (hopefully) this feeling either isn't as experience breaking or is avoided entirely. And for those cases where something truly *wild* happens, the player is usually mentally prepared - whether it be through experience or format restrictions (or lack of).

With this in mind, I knew what I wanted now. I wanted an action card game that's fast-paced, but somehow with the player in more control than ever.

# FateCasted
A competitive card game where almost all of the odds are directly affected or chosen by the player. Wouldn't it be great when even if I lost at the last second due to some crazy volatile mechanic, it was because my opponent actually *made a decision* instead of just getting the exact draws they needed? Wouldn't it be great if when I won because of some crazy strategy it's because I made the choices to make that option work? Wouldn't it be great to cast your own fate? These are some of the driving motivators for the design of Fatecasted.
