Partnership with artists can serve all five [[Release of Documentation#Avenues of Profit|avenues of profit]] if executed correctly.

The main strategy described here is partnering with artists respected and loved by the community with the main focus being to increase *their* visibility. 

A possible business model for this revenue stream is to make a deal with the artist that functions as a sort of perked affiliate marketing with the following important main points:
>[!note] The artist is commissioned to make content for Fatecasted.
>A respected and loved artist serves not only a mascot role for that campaign, but will likely have their own community in which new inquiry and acquisition leads can be obtained.

>[!note] Fatecasted manufactures physical cards using the content.
>Fatecasted will leverage its manufacturing power or partnerships to provide the community with a high quality product.

>[!note] The artist receives a significant share of the royalties of the product for a predetermined period of time to incentivize the artist to promote the product.
>The artist should have something to gain from working with Fatecasted that feels more impactful and more compelling than just *exposure.*

>[!note] The copyright of the actual art itself is classified as work-for-hire, and is setup in a way by Fatecasted that allows derivative work of the design for the purpose of more personalized card designs or manufacturing techniques.
>This business practice should not take away from the goal of the community being able to source their own cards in their own ways.
>>[!question] Is there a better way to achieve the goal of keeping it community-centric that I'm not seeing?

>[!note] Each product under this model is of a limited run.
>Each artist is unique. Fatecasted shouldn't standardize its marketing tactics beyond rudimentary practices. This would make production feel almost factory-like. Each new campaign should feel just as unique as the artist it is trying to promote.
# Pros of this approach...

>[!success] Better than booster packs!
>With all cards that meet the *[[Release of Documentation#Card Requirements for Play|requirements for play]]* being valid, this is the way to reframe something like MTG's cycling Standard, or new-flashy-meta-changing-mechanic model into something that serves to *nurture the community* as well as procure profit.
>
>Players will buy a new set because ***they like the artist,*** not because they *need* it to play. This even makes it viable to release multiple versions of the same set of cards by different artists, maybe even at different times.
>
>They're not *booster packs* to make your deck stronger, they are simply more of a *cosmetic* offered through official channels, which also have the purpose of supporting the artists who collaborate with Fatecasted through leveraging the company's marketing power for *their* benefit in a way that ultimately benefits Fatecasted and its *community*.
# Cons of this approach...
---
>[!error] It is highly personalized.
>Making the marketing campaigns and possibly even manufacturing processes as unique as the artists could lead to volatility in expenses.
>>[!question] Maybe a good route to consider is some form of crowdsourcing for each run?
>>After preliminary research has been done on costs, communicating to the community the associated costs could be a way to place the burden of capital onto the consumer. However, because of the nature of some crowdsourcing practices and expectations, it is also possible for this to come off as offloading the *risk* to them as well. It could be argued that the risk of *disappointment* is larger than any *financial* risk could ever hope to be.
