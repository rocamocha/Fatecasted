Fatecasted started as a small idea... and then it grew bigger and bigger. This is because I saw the potential of the type of gameplay that the original concept behind Fatecasted dared to ask. 

Should the player have more control?
Fatecasted says "Yes."

In the earliest iteration of the game, there were several issues. Much of the inspiration for the game's mechanics came from already existing TCGs that didn't give the player as much control, so some of the underlying components of what a specific mechanic implied about risk and reward in combination with other aspects didn't quite match up.

As the creator of Fatecasted, I want to be as transparent as possible with all players of the game and any communities on what we're doing to progress Fatecasted further, and what our goals will be going forward. It is my hope that this practice makes Fatecasted stronger, more enjoyable, and provide our players with more opportunities to enrich their lives through surrounding themselves with more of the things they love and forming meaningful connections with each other.

# What We Will Do Next
The timing and order of each of these ideas stills needs to be determined.
