## Players want to be creators!
When players enjoy a game, they think of ideas that they think would be cool in that game. But not all players have the depth of information or knowledge about the core concepts of a game to either refine that idea or judge whether it would fit into certain core concepts. This usually manifests itself in discussion or arguments among *players* about how something that was added is the "worst thing ever" or "changed the game in a good way" or maybe even made it "not even the same game anymore."
 
At this point, the creators and developers of a game are left to sort through their ideas and either forced to either interact with or ignore the cries of those fans who are wondering what the heck they're doing.

Fatecasted will attempt to sidestep this issue by providing almost everything to the players about design intention as well as any rejected ideas along with the reason. If anything, Fatecasted will be well-documented.

This also provides the benefit of implied versatility through community philosophy. When you play MTG or YuGiOh or Pokemon TCG, there is an overseeing authority on the rules and conditions, and they are *written* as if they are inherently authoritative.

This "authority" causes 2 things in the general public's mind:
1. They can feel like they are being arbitrarily controlled. At the end of the day, the card game and its mechanics were an idea someone had in order to create some fun. This is not stressed enough in the public awareness of most card games. The focus tends to be on worldbuilding, card art, etc.
   
   But probably most importantly, the focus sometimes is fueled by monetary gain by that authority. WotC need to make money so that they can print more cards to make more money. This goal manifests itself in the game through a few main strategies:
   
   > [!caution] Money money money!
   > 1. The cycling of card sets in the Standard format.
   > 2. Flashy mechanics as a centerpoint of card sets, which are balanced indepedently from sets that didn't exist alongside them when they were allowed in the Standard format.
   > 3. General repackaging of existing content.
   > 4. Near predatory monetization scheme of booster packs.
   
   >[!question] But what about community trades?
   >You may be thinking, "Without all of these things in place, what happens to the community trade economy? Isn't that a huge part of *trading* card games?" And this is a fair point. This is where Fatecasted hopes to [[#Disrupt the Industry]].
# Disrupt the Industry
Fatecasted is merely an idea, as are all card games. The monetization schemes listed above rely on a baseline of distribution and manufacturing power. TCG fans may be lovers of:
- The artists for card art
- The worldbuilding of their game's universe
- The mechanics of the game or format
- Gathering with friends
- Competition
- Creativity (through things such as deck building, finding interaction combos)
- ...Or really, any other aspect of the game

While the monetization schemes listed above actually *do* facilitate all of these things as well as continuous expansion of those things, they aren't the *only* way to approach that goal.

# Avenues of Profit
>[!abstract] How could this possibly make money?
>Fatecasted is not here to make a profit off of people through the game itself. Rather, profits will be realized through:
>1. INQUIRY - Getting new players acquainted to the game.
>2. ACQUISITION - Getting acquainted players excited about the game.
>3. ORGANIZATION - Providing the community with events that enrich their experience with the game and each other.
>4. LICENSING - Licensing the rulebook ***only.*** Every other piece of the game should have the potential to be player sourced aside from the card text database.
>5. TRADEMARK - Merchandising and business conducted with a focus on brand identity and the goals of the project, which has been explained ***not*** to be money!
# Creating Communities in the AI Era
With the advent of technology such as AI image generation and techniques like Stable Diffusion, the world of creatives is weirder than it has ever been. With enough time and enough training data, machines can replicate the overall visual style of certain artworks or artists in a fraction of the time it took for the human production of the training data used. This has resulted in controversy over the value of art created by a human, as with techniques such as image to image transformation minimal human input.

Fatecasted hopes to become a beacon of the future in the way we treat art and its creators by fostering communities through shared appreciation, love, and of course *fun.*
>[!example] To accomplish this, Fatecasted will do the following:
>>[!success] 1 -> The entire card database will open to the public, and players will be encouraged to reach out to creators to make personalized representations of these ideas, or perhaps even create it themselves.
>>
>>The purpose of this is to *individualize* the trading aspect of the community aspect of the game, while also at the same time subconsciously standardizing the format and experience of the game.
>>
>>Games such as Chess and Checkers have been around for ages, and a huge component of that longevity is this process. When you want to play chess, you can buy all sorts of different kinds of chess boards and different pieces. You can even mix and match if your heart so desires. 
>>
>>Meanwhile, in the capitalist trading card industry, only MTG cards originating through an official supply chain of WotC are allowed to be used in play, and in many circles playing with fakes or proxies is frowned upon. Fatecasted will avoid this issue entirely by referring to ***only*** the rules of the game in an authoritative manner.
>
>>[!success] 2 -> Main revenue streams will only ever have the goal to inform, expose, enrich, or supplement.
>> Things purchased through the official Fatecasted supply chain may only ever:
>> 1. Acquaint a new player to the rules of the game.
>> 2. Support artists of the community.
>> 3. Support writers of the community.
>> 4. Provide tools that improve the quality of life for a regular player.
>> 5. Serve the community by connecting them and sharing their appreciation for each other.
>>    
>>>[!quote] As Shannon taught you: don't talk about yourself!
>
>>[!success] 3 -> Fatecasted will be, in spirit, community sourced.
>>In the long run, Fatecasted should become something that is both omnipresent yet highly personalized. The true Fatecasted fan has their set of cards commissioned by an artist they love, using packaging that they love the same way, perhaps with personalized handmade dice, etc.
>>
>>A bit of an analogy to understand the purpose here is that Fatecasted brings the Chess boards, everyone brings their own set of pieces.
>>
>>Of course, distribution accessibility is also a concern. Bespoke cards will of course, not be cheap. But that is also the beauty of this strategy. How one appreciates and experiences art is intimately personal to any person, so there is a high potential for card manufacturing en masse by independents to become a realized future under the right conditions.
>>>[!tip] Possible business moves to make to facilitate this ideology...

# Card Requirements for Play
For a card to be valid for play, it must simply have all the relevant information displayed on the card in a format that matches a predetermined *layout* (i.e. A character card's breakpoint should be displayed on the bottom, the title should be on the top or middle, etc.) by Fatecasted.
