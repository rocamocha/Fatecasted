# Fatecasted

Welcome to the official repository for Fatecasted, a strategy tabletop card game where player control and community creativity take center stage.

## What is Fatecasted?

Fatecasted is a tabletop strategy card game for ages 12 and up. It's designed from the ground up to answer one question: "Should the player have more control?"

Our answer is a resounding **"Yes."**

In Fatecasted, you won't find random booster packs or a constantly shifting meta that forces you to buy new cards to stay competitive. Instead, you'll find a deep, strategic experience where deliberate choices, resource management, and creative thinking are the keys to victory.

### For Players: A New Kind of Card Game

Are you tired of games where victory is decided by a lucky draw? Fatecasted replaces the random "draw phase" of traditional card games with a **Summon Phase**, where both players build their teams with open-ended, deliberate choices.

- **Character Cards:** These are the heart of your team. Each character has a unique type, abilities, and a "Destiny" on the back of the card, offering new strategic options when flipped.
- **Fate Cards:** This is where you express your unique playstyle. By setting cards in your "Fate Area," you introduce unknown variables, creating a tense, psychological battle of wits with your opponent.
- **Deep Strategy:** The game is built on a philosophy of "you can't always be right." Success comes from your ability to analyze the board, anticipate your opponent, and make tough decisions.

Our goal is to create a game that is easy to learn but has a high skill ceiling. A new player will understand the *what* and *how* of an action, while an experienced player will master the *why* and *when*.

### For Creators: A Partnership of Passion

We believe in celebrating the artists who help bring our universe to life. Fatecasted is built on a unique partnership with creators.

- **Limited Edition, Artist-Centric Sets:** Instead of random booster packs, we plan to release limited-run sets of cards featuring commissioned art from talented artists.
- **A True Partnership:** Artists who will collaborate with us should receive a significant portion of the proceeds from their set's sales. We want this to be a partnership that helps everyone grow.
- **Supporting Creativity:** Players collect new sets because they love the artist and want to support their work, not because they need the cards to win. This changes the "new set" dynamic from a competitive necessity to a cosmetic and collectible choice that directly supports the creative community.

This approach allows us to showcase unique artistic styles and give back to the creators who make Fatecasted beautiful.

### For Enthusiasts: An Open, Evolving Universe

Fatecasted is more than just a game—it's a universe we're building together. We're committed to developing the game and its world openly and with your help.

- **The Roadmap:** We have a clear vision for the future, but we want to build it with you. Our development roadmap is public, and we actively seek community feedback.
- **Community-Centric Design:** While we maintain a core set of rules to ensure a consistent experience, we want to empower the community. The art copyright for our partnered sets is structured to allow for derivative works, opening the door for personalized card designs and community-led projects.
- **Get Involved:** This repository is the central hub for everything Fatecasted. Explore the `Core Design` for game mechanics, the `Business Considerations` for our unique approach, and the `Cards` to see the game take shape.

The fate of Fatecasted is in the hands of its players. We invite you to join us on this journey.
