# Design Philosophy
Natalie is an all-rounder that provides spontaneous options. She achieves this by being able to manipulate the only aspect of the game that involves pure chance.

> [!idea] Role Potential
> - Support for characters with abilities that are low chance in a dice spread.
> - Introduce more consistency to strategies involving more basic actions.
> - Consistent way to trigger roll or reroll effects.
