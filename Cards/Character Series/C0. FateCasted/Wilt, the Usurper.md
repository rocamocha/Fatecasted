## Design Philosophy
Provides an extreme alteration of risk / reward based on [[Resources]], [[Damage]], and [[Reinforcement]].
> [!idea] Role Potential
>Has a natural deterrent to [[Break|break]] due to his passive when not in destined form.
>Has an even more powerful tradeoff to [[Break|break]] that can function as a comeback mechanic when destiny is realized.
