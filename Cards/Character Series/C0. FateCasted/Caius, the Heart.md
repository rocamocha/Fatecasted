## Design Philosophy
Caius is a late game character that could require a lot of investment depending on your opponent's strategy and how often they use [[Crystal Charges]].

Making sure to [[Summon]] Caius when the player is not the initiator should in theory be a superior strategy, since the other way around and the opponent has access to their [[Crystal Charges]] right away on their initiator turn immediately afterwards.
