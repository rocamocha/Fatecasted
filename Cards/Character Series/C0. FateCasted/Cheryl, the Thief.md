# Design Philosophy
Cheryl provides more variety options in exchange for representing weaker options in her abilities.

With advanced players, she could have deeply layered implications since the non-initiator will have access to the dice roll in a more granular way once her destiny is realized.
> [!idea] Role Potential
>- Basic dice actions when it's not your initiator turn.
>- AoE [[damage]].
>- Resource conversion through theft.
