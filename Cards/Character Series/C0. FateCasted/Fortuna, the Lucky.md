# Design Philosophy
Fortuna is meant to be a high risk / high reward character. The risk is inherent as she takes a spot in your character and dice spread, with her only option having a high luck requirement. Her destiny, allowing rerolls, simply lowers this luck requirement.

Because of this, she will be inconsistent when not paired with support that facilitates luck manipulation or realizing destiny faster. She will also naturally become less powerful as more characters are [[Break|broken]] throughout the game since the dice pool becomes smaller.
> [!idea] Role Potential
>- Present an early game threat to draw out exaggerated options... things like reducing the dice pool or setting up ways to recover from [[Break|break]]; instead of making less committal decisions.
