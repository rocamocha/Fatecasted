# Design Philosophy
Genevieve is a healer that relies on [[Crystal Charges|crystal charge]]. Because her healing requires playing a [[Crystallized Fates|crystallized fate]], she forces a more committal playstyle to take advantage of her healing.
> [!idea] Role Potential
>Depending on a team's ability to gain [[Crystal Charges|crystal charges]], Genevieve could act as an early game stall or sustainer through her healing when combined with a good offense.
>
>Using the unknown element of [[Fate Cards]] in your [[Fatelines|fatelines]], she could setup some very tricky risk/reward situations based on whether or not you want your opponent to prioritize taking her out.
