>>[!ability] MM : X
>>Your opponent chooses one seeded [[Fatelines|fateline]] to reveal. If `X` [[Crystal Charges|crystal charge]] was paid as an activation cost, you may activate the revealed fate as if it were your own at [[stack level]] `X-1`.

> [!destiny]
>>[!passive]
>>Choose one of your opponent's [[Fatelines|fatelines]]. That fateline is revealed as long as this character is unbroken. When you are the initiator, you may pay `X` [[Crystal Charges|crystal charge]] to activate that fateline as if it were your own at [[stack level]] `X-1`.

# Design Philosophy
Amy provides anticipation or removal of options through providing foresight and potential redirection. The opponent will feel less inclined to play into [[Fatelines|fatelines]] with cards that could also cause themselves significant damage or setback.
> [!idea] Role Potential
>- Use your opponent's power against them!
>- Strategies which use more basic actions or abilities rather than fates will feel safer to the opponent.
