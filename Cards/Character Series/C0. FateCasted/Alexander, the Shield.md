## Design Philosophy
Alexander is meant to provide a [[damage]] buffer to the whole team by making use of reassignment combined with [[reinforcement]]. As the reassignment isn't really useful without reinforcement, he relies on external sources of providing reinforcement until his destiny is realized.

>- [[Break]] prevention by providing a breakpoint buffer, and a way to [[Unbreak]] through reassignment. [[Break|This will keep your dice in-play!]]
