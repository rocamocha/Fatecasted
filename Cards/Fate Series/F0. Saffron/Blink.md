>[!fate]
>>[!ability] Stack Lv0
>>Activate a fate [[Fate Stacking|stacked]] into one of your [[Fatelines|fatelines]] as if it were [[Fate Seeding|seeded]] into its own fateline. 
>
>>[!ability] Stack Lv1

>>Change the seed of 1 of your stacked fatelines to a different card in that fateline.

## Design Philosophy
Provides more open-ended options from fatelines by altering the restrictions around [[Fate Seeding]].

Because of the high time commitment, this card will feel lackluster unless strategies that take advantage of providing more [[Fate Stacking]] opportunities are used.
