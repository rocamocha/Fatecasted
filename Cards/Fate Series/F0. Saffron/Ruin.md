## Design Philosophy
Meant to be a consistent baseline option for [[damage]] increase. The main balancing factors are as follows:
- Having to wait for initiator cycling when played as a commitment through [[fate stacking]] or [[fate seeding]].
- Spending [[Crystal Charges|crystal charge]] when playing from the hand.
