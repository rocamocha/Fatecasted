# The Flow of Battle
## Summon
>[!caution] [[Character Cards#Summoning]]

All players choose a character card to play from standby to play onto the field face-down in any position. This will happen every round until both players have 5 characters on the field in a duel... or all players have 3 characters on the field in a team battle. From the player's view, characters are summoned left to right chronologically on the field. (ie. Your first summon should be on the left and your last should be on the right).

After all players have selected their summon for the round, they are revealed and put into play.

---
## Roll
Each player rolls dice which correspond to the *Type* of each character they have in play.

1 die should be rolled per character, and the *Type* of the die rolled for any character should match the character's *Type.*

After the dice have been rolled, they are now considered in-play.

---
## Fate
>[!caution] [[The Play Area#Fatelines]]

The initiator may stack a single Fate.
All players who are not the initiator may seed up to two Fates after the initiator stacks or declines.

> [[Fate Cards#Core Concepts#Balancing Philosophy]]

---
## Prophecy
All players choose cards from their fate pool to move into their hand until they have 5 cards in hand or no cards remain in their fate pool.

---
## Action
(1) The initiator can declare the use of a basic action or ability during the action phase.

> [!abilities]+ Basic Actions 
> All available basic actions:
> > [!tip] Attack
> > Consume `X` amount of (A)ttack dice to assign `X` damage.
>
> > [!tip] Reinforce
> > Consume `X` amount of (D)efense dice to reinforce for `X`.
>
> > [!tip] Channel
> > Consume `X` amount of (M)agic dice to gain `X` [[Crystal Charges|crystal charges]].
>
> > [!tip] Trigger Fateline
> > Reveal a seeded Fateline and resolve it's effects. 
> 
> > [!tip] Use Ability
> > Whenever an ability is used by the initiator, they may also trigger a Fateline or play a Fate from the hand. The effects of the Fate activated in this way are read and resolved as if they are appended to the text of the ability used.
> 
> > [!tip] End Phase
> > End the action phase.

(2) After an action declaration by the initiator targets another player or indicates a response is allowed, the targeted player can respond by either triggering a Fateline or using an ability. Basic actions are not available to the responder.
>[!caution] About Fates & Fatelines
>[[The Play Area#Fatelines]]
>[[Fate Cards#Fateline Activation]]

After the response is declared and the outcome is resolved or if no response is required / possible, repeat (1) until all dice are consumed or the initiator declares to end the phase.

>[!failure] The total dice cost of abilities used for either player cannot exceed the number of characters that they are in control of at any time.

---
## End
Any effects that take place during the "end phase" are triggered here. Then, the initiator status cycles to the next player.

---
# Important Concepts
## Cycling Initiator
The game is played in "rounds." Each round is a single cycle of the above timeline. After each round, the player numbering cycles by 1 (the last player is now the first and the first is last). The first player in the cycle is the initiator for that round.

>[!caution] The cycling initiator is designed to...
>- ...provide a position of advantage and disadvantage to each player on a rotating basis.
>- ...act as a vehicle to make commitments such as stacking or seeding into fatelines impactful and meaningful.
