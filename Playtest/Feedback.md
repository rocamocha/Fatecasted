# PLAYTEST @ 08.30.2023
>[!abstract] Playtest objective:
>Get a feel for the gameplay flow and player commitment structure.
- Typed dice were not used.
- Crystal charges had little to no functional use for this prototype.
- Pretty much every Fate card was just "thrown together."
### William Trueblood
##### v0.1x000
[[Fate Cards]] seem weak and playing the short game with them seems better.
>[!failure] Playing from the hand as the initiator is too much of a no-brainer.
>>[!question] Should it cost some sort of resource?
>
>>[!question] Maybe Lv0 effects should have drawbacks?
##### v0.1x001
Breakpoints on [[Character Cards]] could be more rounded out / more justified.
>[!failure] This could potentially be related to [[#v0.1x002]]

### Jeric Rocamora
##### v0.1x002
Pacing may be too slow.
>[!failure] This is just caused by raw numbers between certain things.
>Damage numbers are probably too low, and ways to prevent damage are too consistent.
>>[!caution] How much will mechanics from crystal charges change this? Should they?
##### v0.1x003
Fate text seems a bit long worded / overwhelming to read at times.
>[!question] Potentially solved by iconography? Also, explore better technical writing techniques.
