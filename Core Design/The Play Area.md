Players should sit in a round table style alignment, so that each player can keep the cards in their hand hidden from every other player. When there are only 2 players, both players will sit across from each other.

Each player should prepare a clear and flat area in front of them. This area is referred to as that player's play area.

There are 2 zones in each player's play area:
1. Summons
2. Fatelines

Each player's Fate Pool and Character Pool should be easily accessible.

The combined area of all players' play areas is referred to as the battlefield.

> [!tip] About the Dice Box
> If you obtained a Fatecasted starter bundle, it should include a container lined with suede. This is meant to help you when rolling your dice, so that your dice don't go flying everywhere and potentially get mixed up with other player's dice. Everyone rolls at the same time in Fatecasted, so please use your dice box to make it easier for everyone!

# Fatelines
Each player has 3 Fatelines.

Only one fateline or card in hand may be triggered per action or response during the [[Gameplay#Action|Action]] phase.
>[!caution] When stacking or seeding fates, the card is played face down.
