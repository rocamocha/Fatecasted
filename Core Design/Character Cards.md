# Values
Character cards are the main attraction of Fatecasted. The following important pieces of information are displayed on a character card...

>[!info]+ Title
>The title of the card.

>[!rarity]+ Rarity
>Character card rarity ranges from 1 to 5.
 
>[!ctype]+ Type
>See [[#Character Types]].

>[!breakpoint]+ Breakpoint
>The amount of damage needed to trigger a break on this character.

>[!abilities]+ Abilities
>>[!ability] X : Y
>>Listed with the ability should be the cost in the format `X : Y`, where `X` is the dice cost required for activation, and `Y` is the amount of crystal charge needed for activation. Both requirements must be fulfilled to activate the corresponding ability.
>
>>[!passive]
>>Passive abilities are those which do not require activation during the action phase to trigger, and instead are handled by various [[Event Triggers]].

>[!destiny]+ Destiny
>A character's "destiny" is represented by the backside of their card. Players will have the option to flip their character cards over to their destiny through [[Event Triggers]] or [[Fate Cards|Fate Card]] effects.
>
>>Destinies should be either more powerful versions of the character card, or provide different utility. That way they can act both as a dynamic sort of sideboard or a high cost element that has to be scaled into.

# Core Concepts
### Summoning
Character Cards are the main way the player leverages time. By having to build up your team every [[Summon|Summon Phase]], the random chance "draw" phase in other games is replaced with a deliberate and open ended choice by both players.

Character cards are also what enable unique strategies and fun interactions, as they often have abilities or effects that are related to rules of the game or global mechanics.
### Ability Design Philosophy
---
> [!success] Abilities should...
>- Feel like consistently good options by themselves
>- Feel like powerful options when combined with resources
 
> [!failure] Abilities should NOT...
> - Be overwhelmingly powerful, even with a high luck requirement.
> - Become significantly weaker with the passing of time.

If these guidelines are followed correctly, abilities will provide a means of mental pressure on the opponent that is easy to understand and thus easy to make a deliberate response to. We don't want to get into a situation where an experienced player needs to keep reading a card over and over to understand what's going on.

When an ability is used, it should be relatively clear *what* the threat is. A more experienced player should simply know more about *how* it works. The best players will understand the *why* and *when.*

# Character Types
Typing is meant to serve as a balancing mechanic, mainly to prevent certain cards from being able to be played in combination with each other. 

>[!caution] More playtesting is required!
>It is not yet fully understood which aspects of control should be limited through the restrictions around type yet.

### The 3 Basic Types
The 3 basic types of Fatecasted are:
>[!tip] These are also the original 3 types of the first original Fatecasted prototype!
1. ![[Striker]]
2. ![[Protector]]
3. ![[Mystic]]

A team that includes all three of these types should feel well-rounded, balanced, and easy to pick up.
