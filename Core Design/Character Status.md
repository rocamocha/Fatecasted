>[!caution] Try to keep it simple! We don't want to end up like MTG or YuGiOh where there's a million different mechanics between sets to remember, which sometimes kind of generally do the same thing as another mechanic just expressed with different verbage. Anything non-obvious or unintuitive should be able to be put on the character / fate card itself. Otherwise, it shouldn't be in the game!
