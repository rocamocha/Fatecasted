> > A character's "destiny" is represented by the backside of their card. Players will have the option to flip their character cards over to their destiny sides after meeting some sort of prerequisite. Possible requirements could include:
> > 1. Global resource
> > 2. High luck roll
> > 3. Unique resource
> > 4. Damage taken / dealt
> > 5. Damage blocked / healed
> >
> > Destinies should be either more powerful versions of the character card, or provide different utility. That way they can act both as a dynamic sort of sideboard or a high cost element that has to be scaled into.
# Character Status
>[!caution] Try to keep it simple! We don't want to end up like MTG or YuGiOh where there's a million different mechanics between sets to remember, which sometimes kind of generally do the same thing as another mechanic just expressed with different verbage. Anything non-obvious or unintuitive should be able to be put on the character / fate card itself. Otherwise, it shouldn't be in the game!

### Break
When *break* is triggered on a character, they are *broken*.
>[!failure] Dice are not rolled for broken characters.
>This acts as an anti-snowball measure. The player with a broken character potentially loses access to a typed-die; when a different player is the initiator, they lose access to a roll value. This also has the effect of naturally making [[Fate Cards]] and [[Crystal Charges]] more important since the number of dice being rolled will gradually decrease until one player emerges as the victor.

>[!success] Broken characters can still use abilities and their effects may still be triggered unless prevented by a separate mechanic.
>It would be too much of a disadvantage to render character abilities unusable when the character is broken, especially late-game and for some team concepts which could rely on ability interaction.

---
### Unbreak
When an ability or fate *unbreaks* a broken character, that character is moved from the broken position back into the summoned position.
>[!caution] Damage assignment is retained...
>Unbreaking a character does not remove the damage assigned to them. The card just moves out of the broken position. The character can be broken again by assigning more damage to them as long as the total damage is higher than the character's breakpoint.

>[!tip] I need healing!
>When a character is *healed* so that the damage assignment is below their breakpoint, they are unbroken.

# Core Concepts
### Summoning
Character Cards will be the main way the player leverages time. By having to build up your team every [[Gameplay#Summon|Summon Phase]], the random chance "draw" phase in other games is replaced with a deliberate and open ended choice by both players.

Character cards are also what enable unique strategies and fun interactions, as they often have abilities or effects that are related to rules of the game or global mechanics.
### Ability Design Philosophy
---
> [!success] Abilities should...
>- Feel like consistently good options by themselves
>- Feel like powerful options when combined with resources
 
> [!failure] Abilities should NOT...
> - Be overwhelmingly powerful, even with a high luck requirement.
> - Become significantly weaker with the passing of time.

If these guidelines are followed correctly, abilities will provide a means of mental pressure on the opponent that is easy to understand and thus easy to make a deliberate response to. We don't want to get into a situation where an experienced player needs to keep reading a card over and over to understand what's going on.

When an ability is used, it should be relatively clear *what* the threat is. A more experienced player should simply know more about *how* it works. The best players will understand the *why* and *when.*

### Choice Through Positioning?
---
Whether or not to have a Character in the frontline should feel like an important decision when a decision needs to be made, both during play and during construction.

> [!question] Possible ways to create this feeling:
>- Abilities requiring a specific position
>- Positions having global mechanics that affect offense / defense / resources
