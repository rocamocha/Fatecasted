### Fate as a Variable

> [!info] The Magic of The Unknown
> The fate area is the only place where either player can introduce variables unknown to the other player. This should make it a valuable asset not only logistically, but to scout an opponent's decision making and provide opportunities to challenge our opponent's risk analysis style.

Fate stacking provides an additional layer of choice and complexity to what would otherwise be a more volatile RPS through locking more powerful options behind a secondary commitment and keeping primary commitment options rather tame.

### Preparation or Initiative?

> [!question] Both?
Due to the placement of [[Structure of a Turn#Fate|Fate]] in the flow of battle and that the exact nature of commitment made through [[#Fate Stacking]] or seeding is unknown to the other player, a dynamic two-sided call and response decision making pattern can be created between players who make use of their knowledge, creativity, and skill.
