Fate cards are what allow each player to bring their own playstyle to life.

# Fate Stacking
When a Fate is played onto a **seeded** Fateline, that Fateline is now **stacked**.
### Stack Level
When a Fateline is seeded, its Stack Level is 0.
When a player stacks a Fate onto a seeded Fateline, that Fateline's Stack Level increases by 1.

---
# Fateline Activation
Activating a Fateline is how the player triggers the effects listed on their Fate Cards.

When activating an unstacked Fateline, flip that card to reveal it. Then, trigger the effect corresponding to [[#Stack Level]] 0.

When activating a **stacked** Fateline, the cards in the stack are flipped together so that the Fate used to seed the Fateline is revealed on top. Trigger the effects of the top card which correspond to a Stack Level equal to or lower than the Fateline's [[#Stack Level]].

# Crystallized Fates
A fate played from the hand is *crystallized.*

To play a crystallized fate, the player must pay 1 [[Crystal Charges|crystal charge]]. If they cannot pay this cost, the card cannot be played.
# Memories
Memories are special fates that cannot stack. A Memory can be played anytime that the player is able to seed a fate. 

Memories usually have powerful game-changing or tide-turning effects, at the cost of
- having complex / difficult prerequisites for activation
- taking up a fateline for an extended period
- requiring a specific character in play
- additional resources
- et cetera

2. [[#Preparation or Initiative?]]

### Fate as a Variable

> [!info] The Magic of The Unknown
> The fate area is the only place where either player can introduce variables unknown to the other player. This should make it a valuable asset not only logistically, but to scout an opponent's decision making and provide opportunities to challenge our opponent's risk analysis style.
>
Fatecasted is designed with the philosophy "you can't always be right" in mind. Fate stacking provides an additional layer of choice and complexity to what would otherwise be a more volatile RPS through locking more powerful options behind a secondary commitment and keeping primary commitment options rather tame.

---
### Preparation or Initiative?

> [!question] Both?
Due to the placement of [[Gameplay#Fate|Fate]] in the flow of battle and that the exact nature of commitment made through [[#Fate Stacking]] or seeding is unknown to the other player, a dynamic two-sided call and response decision making pattern can be created between players who make use of their knowledge, creativity, and skill.
>
>> [!caution] Game balance will depend greatly on how much *other* aspects of play are affected by certain choices regarding fates.

### Balancing Philosophy
> [!tip] Concept
> The initiator will have the upper hand naturally, since they will have the option to use any fate card including those from their hand as well as their fate area.
>
The defender, on the other hand, has access only to those cards in the fate area.
>
> > [!error] To avoid the problem that one option is overly favorable or predictable for both players, the following ideas should be used when designing card effects:
