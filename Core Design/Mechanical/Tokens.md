>Any kind of token, such as those used to track [[Damage|damage assignments]], [[Reinforcement|reinforcement]], [[Crystal Charges|crystal charges]], [[Mark|marks]], etc. 

When assigning damage, reinforcing, or channeling; always use a token object or [[breakpoint_tracker.png|diagram]] to track the values. Some mechanics involve the different values for a [[Character Cards|character card]], and that's a lot to keep track of in your head between 5 characters and multiple values!
>[!caution] Why is this important?
>This differs from many other action card games because usually, the numbers are "reset" during a *cleanup* phase. Most of the time, carryover effects are a binary state, which can be represented easily (*ie.* Is this tapped or not?).
>>[!idea] This is possibly a byproduct of [[Order of Events (The Stack... Not!)|The Stack]] and it's reverse-timeline complexity.

>Fatecasted, however, handles a ranged state as a carryover value. This makes it orders of magnitude more complex to keep track of mentally, and representing the state isn't as simple as changing the orientation of a card.
