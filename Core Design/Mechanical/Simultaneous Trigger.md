When one or more cards have identical passive triggers and are each triggered by a single action or effect, resolve them in this order:

1. Passive triggers from Character Cards, going left to right.
2. Passive triggers from Fatelines, in order of the player's choosing.
   
Start with the initiator first for both steps, then continue in turn order.
