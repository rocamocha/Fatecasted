(1) The initiator can declare the use of a basic action or ability during the action phase.

> [!abilities]+ Basic Actions 
> All available basic actions:
> > [!tip] Attack
> > Consume `X` amount of (A)ttack dice to assign `X` damage.
>
> > [!tip] Reinforce
> > Consume `X` amount of (D)efense dice to reinforce for `X`.
>
> > [!tip] Channel
> > Consume `X` amount of (M)agic dice to gain `X` [[Crystal Charges|crystal charges]].
>
> > [!tip] Trigger Fateline
> > Reveal a seeded Fateline and resolve it's effects. 
> 
> > [!tip] Use Ability
> > Whenever an ability is used by the initiator, they may also trigger a Fateline or play a Fate from the hand. The effects of the Fate activated in this way are read and resolved as if they are appended to the text of the ability used.
> 
> > [!tip] End Phase
> > End the action phase.

(2) After an action declaration by the initiator targets another player or their character(s), or indicates a response is allowed, the targeted player can respond by either triggering a [[Fatelines|fateline]] or using an ability. Basic actions are not available to the responder.
>[!caution] About Fates & [[Fatelines]]
>![[Fateline Activation]]
>![[Crystallized Fates]]

After the response is declared and the outcome is resolved or if no response is required / possible, repeat (1) until all dice are consumed or the initiator declares to end the phase.
