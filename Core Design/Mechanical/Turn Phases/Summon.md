>[!caution] [[Character Cards#Summoning]]

All players choose a character card to play from standby to play onto the field face-down in any position. This will happen every round until...
- ...both players have 5 characters on the field in a [[Standard Duel Setup|standard duel]].
- ...all players have 3 characters on the field in a [[Team Battle Setup|team battle]].

>[!caution] Card position matters!
>From the player's view, characters are summoned left to right chronologically on the field. (ie. Your first summon should be on the left and your last should be on the right).
>
>![[Simultaneous Trigger]]

Players summon in turn order, starting with the round's initiator.
