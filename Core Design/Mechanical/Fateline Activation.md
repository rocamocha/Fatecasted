Activating (or triggering) a Fateline is how the player invokes the effects listed on their Fate Cards.

When activating an unstacked Fateline, flip that card to reveal it. Then, trigger the effect corresponding to [[Stack Level]] 0.

When activating a **stacked** Fateline, the cards in the stack are flipped together so that the Fate used to seed the Fateline is revealed on top. Trigger the effects of the top card which correspond to a Stack Level equal to or lower than the Fateline's [[Stack Level]].
