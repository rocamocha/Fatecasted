When a [[Character Cards|character]] is suppressed, their abilities and passives will not trigger.

To indicate suppression, the character card should be switched from portrait to landscape orientation (kind of like *tapping* in MTG).

Suppressed characters are unsuppressed after the [[summon]] phase.
