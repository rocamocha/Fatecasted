aliases:
- unbreak
- unbroken

When an ability or fate *unbreaks* a broken character, that character is moved from the broken position back into the summoned position.
>[!caution] Damage assignment is retained...
>Unbreaking a character does not remove the damage assigned to them. The card just moves out of the broken position. The character can be broken again by assigning more damage to them as long as the total damage is higher than the character's breakpoint.

>[!tip] I need healing!
>When a character is *healed* so that the damage assignment is below their breakpoint, unbreak is triggered.
