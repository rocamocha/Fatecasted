Each summoned character has a damage value. When damage is assigned to a character, increase this value by the specified amount for that character.

If a character is assigned damage and is [[Reinforcement|reinforced]], remove one reinforcement per point of damage before assigning the original damage amount minus the amount of reinforcement removed.
