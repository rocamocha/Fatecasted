When *break* is triggered on an unbroken character, they are *broken*.
>[!failure] Dice are not rolled for broken characters.
>This acts as an anti-snowball measure. The player with a broken character potentially loses access to a typed-die; when a different player is the initiator, they lose access to a roll value. This also has the effect of naturally making [[Fate Cards]] and [[Crystal Charges]] more important since the number of dice being rolled will gradually decrease until one player emerges as the victor.

>[!success] Broken characters can still use abilities and their effects may still be triggered unless prevented by a separate mechanic.
>It would be too much of a disadvantage to render character abilities unusable when the character is broken, especially late-game and for some team concepts which could rely on ability interaction.
