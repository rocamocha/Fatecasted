If a certain utility targets too specific of a strategy or mechanic, that utility *may* be equally as weak as it is strong. This is because, depending on the circumstances, the utility may be countered by something as simple as not using the strategy or mechanic that it targets.

>[!tip] 
>To avoid this issue, try to design intended counters more around global or separate mechanics more often than unique mechanics, so that even if the strategy it targets isn't used there may still be a useful effect.

> [!tip] The Valorant Way
> In Valorant you can gain ult charge in various different ways. Try providing a powerful utility that can be accessed in more ways than just a few that can easily be shut down. The difference between these accessibilities should interrelate with the strategy that it dodges when possible. This will be the main burden of balancing.

# When everyone's super, no one is.
We want players to feel like their refined strategy is viable no matter the situation. The only time frustration should set in is when you are getting read like a book when both players are equally familiar with the game. At all costs, avoid creating a metagame that *requires* a very *specific* response to deal with. Players should not feel so powerless to a strategy that they feel their entire team should've been different in order to deal with it.

Balance with regards to the highest level of play. An experienced player feeling like they needed a specific team to defeat a strategy because of a highly nuanced reason is much different than someone who just thinks that the strategy used was *dishonorable, boring, or cheap.*
