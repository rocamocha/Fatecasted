## Complexity is not depth.
Turn phases should be clear and understandable.

There should not be too many of them, and it should not be easy to simply *forget* about an option. 

Any design elements on the card should be fully explainable in 3 bullet points or less, *especially* for those elements which have dynamic interaction with other elements *during* gameplay.

Complexity should be equally realized through how the variety of options interact and the style of player.

For example, Faust players in Guilty Gear enjoy the RNG elements for various reasons -> but if everyone has a bunch of options that were just straight up random, it wouldn't feel balanced. In Season 3 of GGST, they even decided to give Faust an option to remove an element of randomness in exchange for having to set it up by allowing him to store an item...

## I should be the one to defeat my opponent, not my cards.
It should feel like an accomplishment to overcome your opponent, rather than feeling like a coin flip based on things determined before play even begins.

To prevent any semblance of the player being able to predict the victor of the match from the start, the game should be overwhelmingly simple at it's core, and only complex in a dynamic variety of options available to you and your opponent during play.

Usually in other action card games, this dynamic variety is stifled by the ubiquitous "draw phase." The draw phase acts as a limiter to various aspects of the game, attempting to bring some element of *time* into our decision making *outside* the game. So the creativity is often hidden away behind deck building, rather than gameplay - in which case, you are relying almost entirely on the odds to even be *provided* an option.

We want to avoid this by providing a multitude of options that have cascading effects at every turn. Every outcome should feel like it had some kind of deliberation behind it, rather than feeling like it was the result of random chance. The most problematic and somehow still the most *common* example of this is getting a bad draw or a series of bad draws.
# There will be no "bad draws" in Fatecasted.

> [!question] How will this be accomplished?
>1. Player control over random chance in various ways.
>2. Various mechanics not affected by random chance at all.
