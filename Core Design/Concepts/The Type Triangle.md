Much like rock-paper-scissors, character typing attempts to take certain strengths and weaknesses in mind when designing around character type. Abilities should match an overall core idea for certain types.
>[!caution] Don't overdo it!
>This does *not* mean types should *counter* each other. Don't take the rock-paper-scissors analogy too literally!

>[!question] What does this even mean?
>An example of this design philosophy are the different colors in MTG; a red-green deck plays very different from a blue-black, and even between different sets, the overall gameplay *feel* is similar with the same colors.
>
>Another example is character archetypes in fighting games. Often, *rushdown* characters are good at pressuring the opponent at close range but have weak or nonexistant long-range options, while *zoners* are strong at further ranges, and usually have weak defensive options when forced to defend close-up pressure.

>A sort of parallel example are the shielded abyss mages from Genshin Impact. Team composition and considerations around reactions are what make up the complexity in that case. For example, playing a character who deals *blunt* damage is suitable against a Cryo Abyss Mage, but if it's a character that also self-applies Electro or Hydro, that might be detrimental as getting hit would mean the Superconduct or Frozen reaction would proc on that character, causing problems!
